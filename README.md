# GODOT - Graph of Dated Objects and Texts

The aim of this graph database system is to create and maintain a gazetteer of calendar dates in different calendar systems used in the Greek and Roman antiquity all across the mediterranean sea. 
Like geographical gazetteers this authority list can be used to provide stable, unique identifiers (URIs) for each date in any of the calendar systems that has been used to refer to an astronomical day in any ancient source, be it papyri, ostraca or inscriptions. 
It will serve as a means to search and browse ancient texts by their precise temporal footprint using these URIs in digital editions and database or TEI/EpiDoc XML driven projects. 

This repository holds the code for the website which is based on the following frameworks:

- Python Flask
- Neo4j Graph Database
- Apache Solr
