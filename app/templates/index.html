<h1>GODOT &ndash; Graph of Dated Objects and Texts</h1>
<p>The aim of this graph database system is to create and maintain a gazetteer of calendar dates in different calendar
    systems, initially those used in Greek and Roman antiquity across the mediterranean area, and provide links to
    attestations of these dates in online editions. Like geographical
    gazetteers this
    authority list can be used to provide stable, unique identifiers (URIs) for each date in any of the calendar systems
    that has been used to refer to an astronomical day in any ancient source, whether literary texts, papyri, ostraca or
    inscriptions. It
    will serve as a means to search and browse ancient texts by their precise temporal footprint using these URIs in
    digital editions and databases or TEI/EpiDoc XML driven projects.</p>
<p>Currently there are some 5,800 dates in the database, based on more than 7,000 attestations, from a number of
    different ancient calendar and dating systems like:
<ul>
    <li>Roman Consulates, e.g. the consulate of <a href="https://godot.date/id/kzD5fSrfunSJyehaZPCTMR">Hedius Lollianus Terentius Gentianus / Pomponius Bassus (211 AD)</a></li>
    <li>Egyptian Calendar System from the Roman Imperial Period, e.g.: <a
            href="https://godot.date/id/oyMCgjrJRgxiAD3yEtUWwh">Year 8 of Vespasian, month Choiak day 8</a>,
    </li>
    <li>Number of Tribunicia Potestas of a Roman Emperor, e.g. <a href="https://godot.date/id/ptkyoj4dbNWyisxh5xU98c">Eleventh
        Tribunicia Potestas of Roman Emperor Nero</a>,
    </li>
    <li>Combination of Actian Era and Egyptian Calenda System, e.g.: <a
            href="https://godot.date/id/PnfixzEfh7fgBUtvKfTm2Z">Year 144, month Payni</a>.
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Where a clear system of conversions between different calendar systems has been established, dates will be converted
    algorithmically into (proleptic) Julian calendar and Julian Day Numbers. As more and more dates from antiquity are
    linked to the GODOT infrastructure, a complex knowledge graph of ancient dated objects and texts evolves.</p>
<p>Setting up the initial database has been supported by the <a href="https://mellon.org/">Andrew W. Mellon
    Foundation</a> (July - December 2018). All <a href="https://github.com/godot-gazetteer">data</a> can be reused under

<h3>GODOT Workshop: Non-Gregorian Calendar Dates in Digitial Humanities</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom:2em">The first <a href="/workshop">GODOT workshop</a> about non-Gregorian dates in digital environments took place in
    Heidelberg on 26. and 27.
    November 2018 at the <a href="https://www.hadw-bw.de/">Heidelberg Academy of Sciences and Humanities</a>.</p>
